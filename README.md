### About

This is a mod that aims to make trolling your friends easier by adding a block to enable teleportation. Just like the command! It also adds new armour and tools made from a mysterious, craftable ingot. Also, there is the addition of a cool new gun. The enderpearl gun. Never need enderpearls again with this item. It launches enderpearls the same distnace as by hand, you just need to craft it and use it again and again, FOREVER! Cooldown 50 ticks.
